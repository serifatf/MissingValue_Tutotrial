# Introduction

## Why Should you Worry?

1. Bias inferences
2. 

## Causes of Missing Values

# Missing Value Concepts

## Assumptions

$f(y^o, y^m | x) = f(y^o)$

Rubin's taxonomy of missingness;

- Missing Completely at random (MCAR)
- Missing at Random (MAR)
- Missing not at Random (MNAR)

## MCAR

- <span style="color:red"> missingness can't be tied to any cause.</span> It happened completely at random.

- $f(y^o, y^m | x) = f(y^0|x) \alert{f(y^m)}$

- Solution? Just delete the missing records.
